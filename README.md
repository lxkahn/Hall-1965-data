# Hall (1965) data

This repository contains data from:

*Hall, N. T. (1965). Petrology of the Type Merced Group, San Francisco Peninsula, California. M.Sc. thesis, University of California, Berkeley.*

Hall (1965) analyzed samples from the Merced Formation, San Francisco Bay, rivers in the Central Valley, and streams draining the Sonoma Volcanics, with the aim of identifying the main sediment sources for the Merced Formation. This dataset comprises 220 samples and over 52,000 individually identified grains. Within the data, 85 heavy mineral samples and 26,790 grains come from the type section of the Merced Formation south of San Francisco, CA, while 5 samples come from an isolated block of the Merced Formation near Bolinas, CA. 78 heavy mineral samples come from potential sediment sources (San Francisco Bay, the Central Valley, or the Sonoma Volcanics). 34 additional heavy mineral samples are from Miocene -- Pliocene sedimentary rocks near Sebastopol, CA that were previously mapped as the Merced Formation but have since been reclassified as the Wilson Grove Formation. At least 15 mineral categories are identified for each heavy mineral sample. The dataset also includes 11 light mineral samples from the Merced Formation, San Francisco Bay, and the Sacramento River. Hall's discovery in this dataset of a provenance shift from local metamorphic Franciscan sources to igneous Sierran detritus has been referenced in many subsequent publications on the Merced Formation. However, the data themselves have been minimally presented and are only available in a single hard copy of the thesis. Here, we digitize these data and make them openly available. In an accompanying paper, we reanalyze this rich unpublished data set using modern statistical methods.
