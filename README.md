# Hall (1965) data

This repository contains data from:

*Hall, N. T. (1965). Petrology of the Type Merced Group, San Francisco Peninsula, California. M.Sc. thesis, University of California, Berkeley.*

Hall (1965) analyzed samples from the Merced Formation, San Francisco Bay, rivers in the Central Valley, and streams draining the Sonoma Volcanics, with the aim of identifying the main sediment sources for the Merced Formation. This dataset comprises 220 samples and over 52,000 individually identified grains, with at least 15 mineral categories identified for each heavy mineral sample. Within the data, 85 of the samples and 26,790 of the grains come from the section of the Merced Formation covered in this study. Hall's discovery in this dataset of a provenance shift from local metamorphic Franciscan sources to igneous Sierran detritus has been referenced in many subsequent publications on the Merced Formation. However, the data themselves have been minimally presented and are only available in a single hard copy of the thesis. Here, we digitize these data and make them openly available. In an accompanying paper, we reanalyze this rich unpublished data set using modern statistical methods.
